# Overview
This is an E-Commerce Web App. It includes all the basic functionalities like user log in sign up as well as an admin panel and a payment gateway system. I have also included mail sending functionalities for better user experience. I have tried to work with as many dependencies as possible on both client and server side as this was my first major project. You can find the documentation for client and server in their respective folders. Thank you for visiting my website!

# How to start the app

## Required dependencies : 
- Node JS should be installed. [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- JavaScript should be enabled in your browser.

## Steps
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the E-Commerce directory in your terminal.
- Run the following commands.
  1. `npm install --save` This will install dependencies on the server side.
  2. `cd client` This will navigate to the client directory.
  3. `npm install --save` This will install dependencies on the client-side.
  5. `cd ..` Jump back to E-Commerce directory.
  7. `nom run dev` Start the project by running the required scripts on the server and client side. 

##### Server runs on Port 5000 and Client runs on Port 3000. 

### Errors you might face 
- If the above mentioned ports are not free then errors will appear. So make sure your ports are free.
- If node is not installed then the app will crash. Run `node -v` from anywhere in your terminal. If it shows error then re-install node.
- In case any other error, start the whole process again from cloning the repo.
