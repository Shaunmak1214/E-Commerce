# Overview
This is an E-Commerce Web App. It includes all the basic functionalities like user log in sign up as well as an admin panel and a payment gateway system. I have also included mail sending functionalities for better user experience. I have tried to work with as many dependencies as possible on both client and server side as this was my first major project. You can find the documentation for client and server in their respective folders. Thank you for visiting my website!
