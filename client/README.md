# Things the client-side has been built on
### Redux
- Redux forms the backbone for communicating with the rest API we have built on the back-end. 
- Whenever we need to get or post to our server we use **redux actions**.
-  The response from the server is sent to the **redux reducer**. We receive this response as props in our components.
### Material UI
- Most of the material UI components have been integrated into this app. 
- A lot of styling to the material UI is provided by JSS (Css in JavaScript).
- You can refer to the [Material UI Documentation](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/) for further explanation.

# Structure
##### The project is well structured and organised for easy navigation.
#### The public folder contains our index.html. It contains a script provided by **Razor Pay** which is the payment gateway we use in our app.
### Src folder has all the components out app will use : 
- **Actions** contains the actions for redux store.
- **Assets** contains all the static files we use in different places.
- **Components** has those components which will be used everywhere in our app. 
- **hoc** are the higer order components which will wrap our app. Basically our app will be a child of these.
- **reducers** contains the different reducers for redux store.
- **styles** stores the main styles generated by tailwind CSS. Some components have their own styles as well. 
- **Widgets UI** contains all the re-useable components being used thoughout the app.

# Layout
The layout is a functional higher order component. All our routes are passed as children to Layout which it then renders between a header and a footer.
```
<Layout>
  <Routes />
</Layout>
```

And our Layout looks like this 
```
<Header />
  {props.children}
<Footer />
```
##### This structure gives the user a consistent feel while allowing him to navigate the website with utmost ease.
