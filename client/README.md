# Things the client-side has been built on
### Redux
- Redux forms the backbone for communicating with the rest API we have built on the back-end. 
- Whenever we need to get or post to our server we use **redux actions**.
-  The response from the server is sent to the **redux reducer**. We receive this response as props in our components.
### Material UI
- Most of the material UI components have been integrated into this app. 
- A lot of styling to the material UI is provided by JSS (Css in JavaScript).
- You can refer to the [Material UI Documentation](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/) for further explanation.

# Structure
##### The project is well structured and organised for easy navigation.
#### The public folder contains our index.html. It contains a script provided by **Razor Pay** which is the payment gateway we use in our app.
### Src folder has all the components our app will use : 
- **Actions** contains the actions for redux store.
- **Assets** contains all the static files we use in different places.
- **Components** has those components which will be used everywhere in our app. 
- **hoc** are the higer order components which will wrap our app. Basically our app will be a child of these.
- **reducers** contains the different reducers for redux store.
- **styles** stores the main styles generated by tailwind CSS. Some components have their own styles as well. 
- **Widgets UI** contains all the re-useable components being used thoughout the app.

# HOCs
Higher order components are those which affect all routes in our app. They are never called from inside our code. Let's take a look at them.

## Layout
The layout is a functional higher order component. All our routes are passed as children to Layout which it then renders between a header and a footer.
```
<Layout>
  <Routes />
</Layout>
```

And our Layout returns this 
```
<Header />
  {props.children}
<Footer />
```
##### This structure gives the user a consistent feel while allowing him to navigate the website with utmost ease.

## Auth
The Auth hoc has just one job. To check with every route if the user has access or not. Every time we go to some link or refresh page, our component goes throuugh Auth HOC. 

**How it works**
- The Auth is a functional hoc. It receives the component we are about to render as a parameter.

`Auth(Composed Class, authUser, authAdmin)`

- As soon as some route is visited the Auth is called and an action is passed to redux store to get the auth details of the user. 
- The store sends a **GET** request to our server and receives a response with the details of the user if he is logged in or just an `isAuth : false`. 
- It then checks if the user is an admin or not. 
- Based on the above authorisation parameters it allows the user if he has access or redirects them to home page. In case the user is logged in but tried to access and admin route he is shown a Authorisation Revoked page.

##### The Auth hoc is the backbone of the security for our app and therefore very essential.
