          My name is Ritik Agrawal and this is the very first big step to
          achieving my dream. Which is to become a developer not just in the
          field of websites but many other. I study in RV College of Engineering
          and am currently in 2nd year. I have undertaken Mechanical Engineering
          as a major although I have little to no interest in it. Programming is
          what really interests me. I worked quite hard on this and have learnt
          tons of things which will enable me to make some nice projects in the
          future. Thank you for giving my site a tour!
